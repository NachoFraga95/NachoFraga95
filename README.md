**NachoFraga95/NachoFraga95** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- Biochemist from Universidad de Concepción
- Age 27
- Concepción, Chile
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bioinformatics, more specifically High-throughput Sequencing data management and filtering...
- 🔭 I’m currently working on re-processing and cleaning the data I used for my thesis research project, which focuses on the relationship between a Transposable Element subfamily called MITEs and the evolution of transcriptional Enhancers in Xenopus tropicalis bony tissue generating genes...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on perfectioning pipelines used for filtering sequencing data more efficiently and with less effort...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with UNIX code learning, R code learning, statistical methods learning, scientific research paper graph/figure making...
- I'm willing to learn all about informatics and bioinformatics!
The future is now.
